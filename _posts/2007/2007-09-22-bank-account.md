Though the Länsförsökringar internet bank is free of charge, sometimes you dont know how to do with the swedish UI. So I write this mini howto to show the usage.

The main purpose to use the online account is to check your balance, pay the bill and transfer your money from the personal account and saving account.

1. Visit the bank website, for me, the site is [lansforsakringar](http://www3.lansforsakringar.se/ostgota/privat/startsida/default.htm), it locates in the Linköping. Click Bank & fond and it will ask your personal number and password or you can use your encrypter to logon to your online account.

2. Check your bank balance
click this button Transaktioner , then you can check your tranaction history and also the bank balance.

Click Payment, then Register, fill the following form and click next, 
then you will use your encrypter to input the number showed on the screen, the encrypter will then produce a confirm code. 
Then you have made this payment.

Often, you want to transfer money from the private account to your saving account, and vice versa. Follow these steps you will find it is very easy to do that.
